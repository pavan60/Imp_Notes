square root of -1
In a group of people, non mathematicians would think of the proofs given by scientists but a Mathematician
will simply skip this question ;p


The complex numbers are best thought of as vectors in a plane. 
1 and -1 have endpoints in the unit circle.
They both have magnitude (absolute value) 1 but point in opposite directions. 
i and -i also have magnitude 1 but are perpendicular to 1 and -1. 
1 has an angle of 0 -1 has an angle of 180. 
When you multiply you add the angles. 
0+0=0 180+180=360 which is the same as 0. 
i has an angle of 90. 90 + 90 = 180. 
And so on. So is that not a fact of everyday life?



SAAS	PAAS	IAAS

saas: You have already built a website/application(Eg: www.computenext.com). 
And you want to host your website/application, you go for this cloud service.

paas: You are planning to build a website/application(Eg: www.computenext.com). 
And you don't want to buy Visual studio/Photo shop .. etc softwares on your own. 
You think if someone would rent you the software license for a week or month. paas will be best option.

iaas: You want to build a website/application, 
you want the license of the visual studio/photoshop and you also want to make sure that the system which you work will have certain computational capabilities. 
iaas comes into picture.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): hardware is provided by an external provider and managed for you

Platform as a Service (PaaS): in addition to hardware, your operating system layer is managed for you

Software as a Service (SaaS): further to the above, an application layer is provided and managed for you - you won't see or have to worry about the first two layers

 to diplay all used dns list type    ipconfig /displaydns  in cmd
 to flush                            ipconfig /flushdns
 simply search using                 chrome://net-internals/#dns

        How to Check & Fix it – if your PC/Computer/Laptop has been Hacked?

Well..It’s the most Dangerous thing..Don’t Worry I’ll help you to Check and Fix it up!

[Caution : Enable Firewall or Keep it on & if you have any Free Anti-virus please un-install it-Sign of Danger]

Note: This guide is for all Versions of Windows from Windows2000 onwards.

Please follow step-by-Step Process(No Virus or System Compromise – Trust it).

Step 1 : Go to Start

Step 2 : Either type cmd in Run option or Go to All Programmes > Accessories > Command
Prompt

Step 3 : Type > system.ini press enter

Step 4 : A note pad will open as showing following text below:

; for 16-bit app support
[386Enh]
woafont=dosapp.fon
EGA80WOA.FON=EGA80WOA.FON
EGA40WOA.FON=EGA40WOA.FON
CGA80WOA.FON=CGA80WOA.FON
CGA40WOA.FON=CGA40WOA.FON

[drivers]
wave=mmdrv.dll
timer=timer.drv
[mci]

Step 5 : a) Watch or look at [drivers] text > if it highlights > user=user.drv (OMG! Your
System was Compromised/Hacked)

Illustration as below:

; for 16-bit app support
[386Enh]
woafont=dosapp.fon
EGA80WOA.FON=EGA80WOA.FON
EGA40WOA.FON=EGA40WOA.FON
CGA80WOA.FON=CGA80WOA.FON
CGA40WOA.FON=CGA40WOA.FON

[drivers]
wave=mmdrv.dll
user=User.drv
[mci]

b) If you are Lucky it should show the Text under [drivers] as timer=timer.drv (You’re
safe, i.e; your System is safe ??

Illustrated as below:

; for 16-bit app support
[386Enh]
woafont=dosapp.fon
EGA80WOA.FON=EGA80WOA.FON
EGA40WOA.FON=EGA40WOA.FON
CGA80WOA.FON=CGA80WOA.FON
CGA40WOA.FON=CGA40WOA.FON

[drivers]
wave=mmdrv.dll
timer=timer.drv
[mci]

Step 6 : If you’re System is Safe > you can peacefully use you’re system after restarting it.

Step 7 : If it is Hacked [step 5 > a)] then follow the steps further as indicated below:

Step 8 : Type msconfig in run option from start menu > press enter

Step 9 : Pop-up will open > Look at Startup button or option on the top right hand side of the pop-up window > Click on it

Step 10 : Look at Manufacturer very closely > if it indicates System or Admin leave it as it is but if it shows “UNKNOWN” > this can be possibly be Virus/Trojan or Hackers Malicious Software

Step 11 : Uncheck it by clicking on the check-box or Select it and Click on Delete option

Step 12 : Click on Apply > Ok > Restart the later.

Step 13 : Go to task Manager from Task Bar > Click on processes > view option > Select coloum > Click on PID [Process identifier or process ID : meaning a unique number assigned or given to a process running in the system] Check-box > then click OK

Step 14 : Note a PID Coloum is Added this is visible under process

Step 15 : Go to Command promt or cmd [step1&2] type >netstat > enter

Step 16 : Look at state coloum > if it indicates Established > then look at PID Number of Established IP > go to task manager> Processes>Closely watch PID number Assigned to IP Address and Click on End Now.

[Note: if you don’t find PID Number > Restart and Follow the steps from Step 13 Onwards- it will solve you’re issue]

or Alternative way to find PID is listed below – Once you find PID Number of Established IP > Follow from Step:

-Start Command promt or cmd from start Menu [indicated in Step 1 & 2]
-type > netstat -ano [note: netstat in small and then one space after that use dash -and type ano without space] and enter-Note Down PID Number of Established IP and Find it in Task Manager and Click on End Task Now
-Restart you’re system PC/Laptop/Desktop once all PID with Established is Removed.

 


FERMAT : If p is prime then a (power p)-a is divisible by p.
